\begin{acknowledgements}


I would like to acknowledge and express my gratitude to my supervisors, Dr Maria Indrawan-Santiago and Dr Pari Delir
Haghighi, who have assisted and supported me throughout the duration of this research, providing great brains for me to
bounce ideas off and providing me with much needed criticism on my work. The Faculty of Information Technology,
at Monash University, have also provided much resources and support, for which I am greatly appreciative. I also would like
to acknowledge Minh Quan Ngo and Weng Long Pang for their support in providing support, in the forms of proofreading and editing, for this thesis.

The shared office space provided by both the Faculty of Information Technology at Clayton and Caulfield campuses of Monash
University has been an essential resource for me throughout the duration of this research and the writing of this thesis.
This is also greatly appreciated, allowing me to have a space to work, think, and play.

Lastly, I would like to thank my friends at Monash University, also researching and writing their theses, for keeping me
sane. Particularly, Minh Quan ``Romy'' Ngo, Jian Loong Liew, and Weng Long Pang.
