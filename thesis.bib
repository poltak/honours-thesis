  abstract = {This paper describes the use of Storm at Twitter. Storm is a real-time fault-tolerant and distributed stream data processing system. Storm is currently being used to run various critical computations in Twitter at scale, and in real-time. This paper describes the architecture of Storm and its methods for distributed scale-out and fault-tolerance. This paper also describes how queries (aka. topologies) are executed in Storm, and presents some operational stories based on running Storm at Twitter. We also present results from an empirical evaluation demonstrating the resilience of Storm in dealing with machine failures. Storm is under active development at Twitter and we also present some potential directions for future work.},

Programmers find the system easy to use: more than ten thousand distinct {MapReduce} programs have been implemented internally at Google over the past four years, and an average of one hundred thousand {MapReduce} jobs are executed on Google's clusters every day, processing a total of more than twenty petabytes of data per day.},

  abstract = {Merchants selling products on the Web often ask their customers to review the products that they have purchased and the associated services. As e-commerce is becoming more and more popular, the number of customer reviews that a product receives grows rapidly. For a popular product, the number of reviews can be in hundreds or even thousands. This makes it difficult for a potential customer to read them to make an informed decision on whether to purchase the product. It also makes it difficult for the manufacturer of the product to keep track and to manage customer opinions. For the manufacturer, there are additional difficulties because many merchant sites may sell the same product and the manufacturer normally produces many kinds of products. In this research, we aim to mine and to summarize all the customer reviews of a product. This summarization task is different from traditional text summarization because we only mine the features of the product on which the customers have expressed their opinions and whether the opinions are positive or negative. We do not summarize the reviews by selecting a subset or rewrite some of the original sentences from the reviews to capture the main points as in the classic text summarization. Our task is performed in three steps: (1) mining product features that have been commented on by customers; (2) identifying opinion sentences in each review and deciding whether each opinion sentence is positive or negative; (3) summarizing the results. This paper proposes several novel techniques to perform these tasks. Our experimental results using reviews of a number of products sold online demonstrate the effectiveness of the techniques.},

  abstract = {In recent years, real-time processing and analytics systems for big data--in the context of Business Intelligence ({BI})--have received a growing attention. The traditional {BI} platforms that perform regular updates on daily, weekly or monthly basis are no longer adequate to satisfy the fast-changing business environments. However, due to the nature of big data, it has become a challenge to achieve the real-time capability using the traditional technologies. The recent distributed computing technology, {MapReduce}, provides off-the-shelf high scalability that can significantly shorten the processing time for big data; Its open-source implementation such as Hadoop has become the de-facto standard for processing big data, however, Hadoop has the limitation of supporting real-time updates. The improvements in Hadoop for the real-time capability, and the other alternative real-time frameworks have been emerging in recent years. This paper presents a survey of the open source technologies that support big data processing in a real-time/near real-time fashion, including their system architectures and platforms.},

  abstract = {As the undisputed pioneer of big data, Google established most of the key technologies underlying Hadoop and many of the {NoSQL} databases. The Google File System ({GFS}) allowed dusters of commodity servers to present their internal disk storage as a unified file system and inspired the Hadoop Distributed File System ({HDFS}). Google's column-oriented key value store {BigTable} influenced many {NoSQL} systems such as Apache {HBase}, Cassandra and {HyperTable}. And, of course, the Google {MapReduce} algorithm became the foundation computing model for Hadoop and was widely implemented in other {NoSQL} systems such as {MongoDB}.
{YARN} provides much more than just improved scalability, however; it treats traditional {MapReduce} as just one of the possible frameworks that can run on the cluster. {YARN}, therefore, will allow Hadoop clusters to execute non-{MapReduce} workloads. Work is underway on a number of such applications, including Spark, Storm, Giraph, and Hama.
Only the very largest Hadoop users are likely to benefit from {YARN}'s scalability improvements. For the rest of us, the ability to extend the range of Hadoop analytics is far more significant. At the end of the day, a Hadoop cluster is only as valuable as the analytic insights it can provide. By extending the range of possible analytic models, {YARN} should contribute to the long-term success of Hadoop.},
